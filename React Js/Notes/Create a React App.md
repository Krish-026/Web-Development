### Create React App

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is a comfortable environment for **learning React**, and is the best way to start building **a new [single-page](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#single-page-application) application** in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have [Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine. To create a project, run:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

> Note
> 
> `npx` on the first line is not a typo — it’s a [package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b).

When you’re ready to deploy to production, running `npm run build` will create an optimized build of your app in the `build` folder. You can learn more about Create React App [from its README](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#create-react-app--) and the [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/).
